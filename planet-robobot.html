        <div class="GamePageBody">
          <p>It's a regular day on Planet Pop Star, Kirby's homeland. That is, until 
            you see a giant spaceship in the distance. This ship, the Access Ark, is 
            the home of the Haltmann Works Company. You can't help but watch as the 
            Access Ark invades and mechanizes your planet. Or you attempt to fight 
            back, like King Dedede and Meta Knight, and fail. Or maybe you're Kirby, 
            who sleeps through the whole thing.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Kirby wakes up and sees that his planet has been completely 
            transformed, so he decides to go on an adventure to turn Pop Star back to 
            normal.</p>
        <p>Kirby travels through some locations (Patched Plains and Resolution Road) 
            and fights some enemies (Clanky Woods and Holo Defense API) before eventually 
            meeting Susie, Haltmann Work Company's secretary and administrative assistant, 
            in Overload Ocean. </p>
        <p>Through Susie, Kirby learns that her company is extracting Pop Star's resources, 
            and the planet's natives are getting in the way of doing this. In her eyes, they're 
            obstacles. Susie's attempt to defeat Kirby fails, so she runs away for now.</p>
        <p>Kirby finds Susie again, this time at Gigabyte Grounds. Susie sings the Haltmann 
            company theme song (called 'The Noble Haltmann') and tells Kirby that Meta Knight 
            was captured and transformed into a cyborg (Mecha Knight). Kirby defeats Mecha 
            Knight and proceeds to Rhythm Route.</p>
        <p>Kirby meets Susie (again). She sings The Noble Haltmann (again) and introduces 
            the Dedede Clone, created from, you guessed it, King Dedede's DNA. The Dedede 
            Clone attempts to fight Kirby but fails. Kirby moves on ahead to the Access Ark.</p>
        <p>Kirby infiltrates the Access Ark and after defeating more robots, makes it to 
            the office of the president of the Haltmann Works Company. Susie is there once 
            again, scolding Kirby for his lack of manners. She introduces a new and improved 
            version of Mecha Knight, Mecha Knight+, which Kirby has to fight. Kirby defeats 
            Mecha Knight, and Meta Knight is free from Susie's control. President Haltmann 
            reveals himself, dismisses Susie from his office, and confronts Kirby himself.</p>
        <p>According to Haltmann, Haltmann Works Company has reactivated the supercomputer 
            Star Dream after studying some of the universe's most advanced civilizations. 
            Haltmann fights Kirby in his own mech, but Kirby ends up defeating him (who 
            would have guessed? Haha). Exasperated by the world's “savages,” Haltmann 
            attempts to activate Star Dream, who ends up taking control of Haltmann's body.</p>
        <p>Star Dream, through Haltmann, announces its intent to wipe out all life in 
            existence, as the universe's life forms are getting in the way of the Haltmann 
            Works Company's eternal prosperity. Susie (she is still here!) realizes what is 
            happening and asks Kirby to stop Star Dream. Kirby sets off to space, where Star 
            Dream is now located.</p>
        <p>Star Dream takes control of the entire Access Ark and becomes a sentient planet. 
            After Kirby breaks off pieces of the Access Ark's shell, it is revealed that it 
            is actually a Galactic Nova, one of the clockwork stars that float through the 
            cosmos and grant wishes.</p>
        <p>In order to defeat Star Dream for good, Kirby's Robobot armor's hand turns into 
            a giant screwdriver. Star Dream is screwed in half and explodes along with Haltmann. 
            The explosion undoes Pop Star's mechanization, and Kirby returns to Pop Star. 
            Capitalism has been defeated (at least in the Kirby universe).</p>
