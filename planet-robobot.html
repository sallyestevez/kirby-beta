              <h3 class="question">What's so special about Mira?</h3>
              <p>Well, there's just something about this planet.</p>
              <p>Mira is 155 square miles of exhilaration. You get to explore not
                one, but FIVE different regions. From Oblivia's dry climate, to Cauldros'
                volcanic terrain, there's something for everyone.</p>
              <h3 class="question">What does Mira look like?</h3>
              <p>This is a very broad question. It would be better to ask what each region
              looks like instead, since they are all so different. Feel free to learn
              more about the different regions by clicking on each of the links at the
              top of the page.</p>
              <p>We can provide you with this map of the planet.</p>

              <h3 class="question">How do you get there?</h3>
              <p>You'll be traveling through space, along with the other lucky passengers.
                However, no one actually knows where Mira is. Trust us when we say that
                you'll get here. Eventually. Also, you can't go back. We're stuck on
                Mira forever.</p>
              <h3 class="question">Where will I be staying on Mira?</h3>
              <p>You'll be staying in New Los Angeles (NLA), located in Primordia! More info
                under <a href="primordia.html">Primordia's page</a>.</p>
              <h3 class="question">How can I get around while on Mira?</h3>
              <p>Either by walking/running everywhere or by Skell. Cars are not
              recommended outside of NLA.</p>
              <h3 class="question">What is a Skell? How can I get it?</h3>
              <p>A Skell is a giant mech. In its bipedal form, you can walk around or fly
                in it. It can also transform into a vehicle. All of these forms make it
                easier for you to travel around Mira. You can only get a Skell if you
                pass the Skell License Certification Test.</p>
