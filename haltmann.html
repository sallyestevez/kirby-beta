              <p>Max Profitt Haltmann, or simply President Haltmann, is a certified businessman, 
                the ambitious and cold-hearted CEO of the Haltmann Works Company, and the main 
                antagonist of Kirby: Planet Robobot.</p>
            <p>Likes: his company, numerals, inventions, analyzing celestial bodies and climates, 
                eating high-class chicken</p> 
                <p>Dislikes: opposition, other people, Kirby</p>

            <p>Like certain real-life CEOs, Haltmann is willing to do whatever he can to make his 
                company profit (it's in his name!). In his case, it means invading and mechanizing 
                other planets for their resources. The last part actually sounds pretty familiar 
                but I won't say anything else about it.</p>
            <p>He believes he's intellectually superior to the natives of other planets and feels 
                they are savages with no manners, which explains why he has no problems invading 
                their homes. Yes, he's a colonizer.</p>

              <p>Haltmann is very proud of his mech, the Executive Suit, with its gold body adorned 
                with lilac and red gems. He is also very proud of his hovering golden chair, which he 
                uses when he's not piloting his mech. Fit for a CEO, don't you think?</p>

            <p>Haltmann and his daughter, Susie, used to travel throughout the cosmos together. 
                At one point discovered Star Dream, a wish-granting supercomputer, and its blueprints. 
                He was able to partially reactivate Star Dream with the help of the blueprints and by 
                researching the universe's most advanced civilizations</p>

        <p>Haltmann conducted tests on Star Dream regularly, until there was an accident, resulting in 
            Susie being warped to another dimension. Believing Susie had died, Haltmann decided to spend 
            all his time and energy into fully reactivating Star Dream. He hoped that he could revive his 
            daughter and see her again. However, he lost his memories of her the more he relied on Star 
            Dream.</p>
        <p>It turned out that Susie was not dead, but when she came back, Haltmann did not recognize her. 
            Haltmann ended up hiring her as secretary and administrative assistant of the Haltmann Works 
            Company, as deep down he felt she was familiar.</p>
        <p>With Susie now part of the Haltmann Works Company team, Haltmann was ready to proceed with his 
            business plan of eternal prosperity: the Mechanization Occupation Project.</p>

            <p>Star Dream Soul OS, fought in The True Arena, begins to erase Haltmann's soul as it's no longer 
                needed to function properly. While his soul is being erased, Haltmann wonders why he reactivated 
                a machine as terrible as Star Dream, and ultimately remembers Susie and his wish to see her again. 
                He regrets believing that Star Dream would have ever been able to grant that wish. Star Dream Soul 
                OS successfully deletes all remaining traces of Haltmann, including both his memories and soul.</p>
