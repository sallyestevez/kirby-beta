              <p>He's pink. He's round. And he's puffy. He's been on countless adventures, and he's 
                saved his planet, Pop Star, tons of times, too. He can inhale enemies and gain their 
                powers. He's been around for over thirty years and is loved by all. His games are so 
                sweet that he'll give you a sugar rush. And he's so cute that you can't help but smile.

            <p>Kirby has been in over 30 games, starting with Kirby's Dream Land in 1992. Since then, 
              he has starred in Kirby's Adventure (1993), Kirby Super Star (1996), Kirby Air Ride (2003),

            <p>Kirby is a cheerful and positive being who cares about those close to him. He is always willing 
              to help those around him, even going out of his way to do so. He's also very brave, not being 
              afraid to fight eldritch abominations when necessary. That doesn't mean Kirby isn't forgiving, 
              as he can become friends with those he's fought in the past. Examples of enemies to friends 
              include King Dedede, Magolor, Susie, and Meta Knight.</p>

              <p>Kirby's inhale, introduced in Kirby's Dream Land, is one of his most well-known abilities. 
                As the name implies, Kirby can inhale enemies and objects. He can either swallow what he 
                inhaled or spit it out, which is known as a star spit. In later games, swallowing certain 
                enemies gives Kirby a Copy Ability.</p>

              <p>Copy Abilities were introduced in Kirby's Adventure. After inhaling and swallowing certain 
                enemies with special powers, Kirby can also gain those powers. There are over 40 Copy Abilities 
                in the series, and each Copy Ability has a unique moveset! Starting in Kirby Super Star, Kirby 
                also gets a unique hat for each Copy Ability.</p>
